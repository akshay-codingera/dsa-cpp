## 🔹 What is Stack?
Stack is a linear data structure that follows **LIFO (Last In First Out)** principle.

## 🔹 Operations Used
- push()
- pop()
- top()
- empty()
- size()

## 🔹 Problem Categories
- Easy: Basic stack usage and confidence-building problems
- Medium: Pattern-based problems like monotonic stack
